# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: Git is a version control system for software development that can keep track of changes to a repo or files within a repo. It also allows for collaboration on a project and keeps a history of what changes have been made to a repo or file. It works locally by being installed on your own personal computer. The difference between git and github is that is a website that allows your repos to be hosted which means that it is available worldwide and allows users remote access to the repo's.

Researched answer: Git is an open sourced version control system used to share code you are working on and allows many people to contribute to the code, all while tracking the changes made and who made them (source: syllabus). Github is one of the many code hosting platforms used to collaborate on software development projects that allows users from anywhere in the world to work together on the code. (source:doc.github.com).

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer: The comparison operator will return a boolean value I believe. ***This question really confused me. Is it asking for the return of a boolean value of "true" or "false" or for the actual datatype of "boolean" as a value returned? 

Researched answer: Researching this question led to more confusion. I was able to come up with the datatype "Boolean" as a typeOf (operator) value and Boolean value as true and false. 
What I ultimately came up with is Comparison and Logical operators which are used to test for true or false. They are used to determine the difference between values. They are ==, ===, !=, !==, <, >, <=, and >=.

3. What is the difference between an array's index and its value?

Your answer: An arrays's index is an address to the value stored at the number, starting from 0 (zero indexed) and the value is what is stored at the address.

Researched answer: The value in an array has an address known as the index. The value of an array's index at the particular known location must be a Javascript datatype. (source: syllabus)

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: Both arrays and strings can be accessed using index. Both can also use the .slice or .concat mutator. The difference is a string has characters as its value and arrays can have multiple datatypes in it including strings as it's value. An array can contain strings but a string can't contain an array it has to be converted using the split() function.

Researched answer: Arrays and strings have a length property and each character in the string, or value in an array can be accounted for by its placement called an index. A string is one piece of information and an array is group of things such as a collection, that is ordered. In a string the data is surrounded by "" (double quotations surrounding it), and an array, the data is surrounded by [] (square brackets). Strings can only contain characters and arrays can contain any datatype in Javascript. 

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: Pair Programming enables multiple individuals to collectively work on code together. When pair programming, one person is the driver who is the one typing up all the code and is receiving input from other individuals in the pair or mob is known as navigators. The driver is the only one coding and is responsible for following the instructions fo the navigator. This process allows for 2 sets of eyes or more on a coding project and makes it easier to catch mistakes and keep focus on coding. The driver and navigator should switch positions regularly.

Researched answer: A team of 2 or more individuals with one driver who is in charge of entering all the information received from other members of the team known as navigators. Navigators help keep focus on coding, hold the driver accountable and talk about the code to bring their knowledge to the problem. Pairs or mobs should rotate roles every 10-20mins and take breaks when necessary.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: are built in methods that take a function as an argument. Often they used to operate on arrays. They will execute for every item in array which makes them useful for iteration. (source: Syllabus/blob/main/javascript/higher-order-functions.md)

2. Jest: is a testing framework in Javascript made up of a collection of files called dependencies that house pieces of code. Using all these pieces of code together correctly allows test to be run on the code. (source: Syllabus/blob/main/javascript/jest.md)

3. Objects: a datatype that can contain static information as well as actions from methods in pairs known as key:value. 

4. Method: is a function that belongs to an Object. this. is the keyword that references that object.

5. Classes: classes are a type of function and just like functions have their own use case. They are a type function that contain data and behavior.
